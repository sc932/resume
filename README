This is my resume in LaTeX

It is based off a template I found a few years ago, which was a modified template, see the (C) list at the top for a history.

Feel free to fork and edit.

In linux a simple
$ pdflatex resumeName.tex
should kick out a resumeName.pdf

Good luck and happy job hunting! (PS As of September 2011 I am looking for a job :) )
